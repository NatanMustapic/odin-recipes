    <p>Traditional chili is a type of spicy stew that typically contains ground meat and chili powder, plus beans and tomato. There's a ton of variation when it comes to chili, but you can tell it apart from other stews by its heavy use of fresh chilis and/or chili powder. When we say chili has a lot of variation, we mean it.</p>
